# Multiple environments, linked using `reference_tasks`

Reference tasks are a powerful feature of Flyte, that allow you to create a set of tasks that can be used in different environments without having to duplicate the code. This is particularly useful when you have multiple environments with different configurations or dependencies.
This also allows you to share tasks between different projects, without sharing the code itself, but rather the task definitions.
